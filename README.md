# PigeonNet

## Overview
PigeonNet is a decentralized communication technology designed for off-internet situations. It enables users to send and receive messages securely without relying on the internet or GSM networks, particularly in regions where access is restricted or banned. The system operates as a cohesive network, allowing users to communicate even in the most challenging environments.

## Problem Statement
In many parts of the world, governments restrict access to the internet and traditional communication methods, especially during crises. PigeonNet aims to provide a secure and reliable means of communication for individuals in such situations, ensuring that critical information can be shared without fear of censorship or surveillance.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Network**: Users can opt to become nodes in the network, contributing to message relaying and enhancing the system's resilience.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Utilize Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, and mesh networking for direct device-to-device communication.
- **Intelligent Message Routing**: The network can predict the best path for messages to travel based on user behavior and network dynamics.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure that messages remain private and secure from interception.
- **Minimal Identification**: Users can register with minimal personal information, enhancing privacy and security.
- **Seamless Operation**: The network functions as a cohesive unit, with nodes working together to relay messages without individual notifications.

## Technical Details
### Technologies Used
- **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct**: For direct communication between devices.
- **Mesh Networking**: To allow devices to connect and relay messages without a central server.
- **Encryption Protocols**: Implement end-to-end encryption using established cryptographic methods.
- **Mobile Application Frameworks**: Use frameworks like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.
- **LoRa???
