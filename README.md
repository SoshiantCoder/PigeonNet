üåå Attention, Inhabitants of Earth! üåç

The need for a decentralized communication system is critical for your survival. In a world where access to information is increasingly restricted, secure communication is essential for those facing crises and oppression.

PigeonNet is designed for your off-internet situations, enabling secure messaging when traditional channels fail.
üîë Key Features:

    Decentralized Network: Users can opt to become nodes in the network, contributing to message relaying and enhancing the system's resilience.
    Peer-to-Peer Communication: Utilize Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, and mesh networking for direct device-to-device communication.
    Intelligent Message Routing: The network can predict the best path for messages to travel based on user behavior and network dynamics.
    End-to-End Encryption: Ensure that messages remain private and secure from interception.
    Minimal Identification: Users can register with minimal personal information, enhancing privacy and security.
    Seamless Operation: The network functions as a cohesive unit, with nodes working together to relay messages without individual notifications.

üåê Empowering your kind in regions with restricted access is not just important; it is vital.

Call for Contributions

PigeonNet is an open-source project that relies on the contributions of passionate individuals. If you are interested in helping build a secure communication system, your input is welcome! Whether you are a developer, designer, or simply someone who believes in the mission, collaboration is key.
Overview

PigeonNet is a decentralized communication technology designed for off-internet situations. It enables users to send and receive messages securely without relying on the internet or GSM networks, particularly in regions where access is restricted or banned. The system operates as a cohesive network, allowing users to communicate even in the most challenging environments.
Problem Statement

In many parts of the Earth, your governments restrict access to the internet and traditional communication methods, especially during crises. PigeonNet aims to provide a secure and reliable means of communication for individuals in such situations, ensuring that critical information can be shared without fear of censorship or surveillance.
